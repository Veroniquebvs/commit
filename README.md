# commit
comment rédiger un bon commit
The ‘commit’ action refers to saving changes to a source code repository. It is a key step that allows developers to save their progress and share their changes with other team members. A commit is often accompanied by a message that provides context or explains the changes made, facilitating collaboration and tracking of different versions of the code.
What should this message contain?
- The message must contain 72 characters
- It must summarise what the commit does
- It must begin with a capital letter
- It must not end with a full stop
- When changes have been made, a prefix will be added to the beginning of the message. ‘Feat’ will be used when a new feature has been added. Use ‘fix’ when a bug has been fixed.
